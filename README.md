# 💡 WeKnora — Turn Documents into Living Knowledge with RAG, Agents and Auto-Wiki

## 📌 Overview

[**WeKnora**](https://weknora.weixin.qq.com) is an open-source, LLM-powered knowledge framework built for enterprise-grade document understanding, semantic retrieval, and autonomous reasoning.

It is organized around three core capabilities: **RAG-based Quick Q&A** for everyday lookups, a **ReAct Agent** that autonomously orchestrates retrieval, MCP tools and web search to handle complex multi-step tasks, and a brand-new **Wiki Mode** in which agents distill raw documents into a self-maintaining, interlinked markdown knowledge base with an interactive knowledge graph. Combined with multi-source ingestion (Feishu / Notion / Yuque, and growing), 20+ LLM provider integrations, full Langfuse observability, and a fully self-hostable modular architecture, WeKnora turns scattered documents into a queryable, reasoning-capable, continuously evolving knowledge asset.

The framework supports auto-syncing knowledge from Feishu, Notion, and Yuque (more data sources coming soon), handles 10+ document formats including PDF, Word, images, and Excel, and can serve Q&A directly through IM channels like WeCom, Feishu, Slack, and Telegram. It is compatible with major LLM providers including OpenAI, DeepSeek, Qwen (Alibaba Cloud), Zhipu, Hunyuan, Gemini, MiniMax, NVIDIA, and Ollama. Its fully modular design allows swapping LLMs, vector databases, and storage backends, with support for local and private cloud deployment ensuring complete data sovereignty. WeKnora also integrates with **Langfuse** for comprehensive observability into agent reasoning, token usage, and pipeline tracing.


## ✨ Latest Updates

**v0.5.2 Highlights:**

- **Wiki Mode at Scale**: Wiki ingest now handles tens-of-thousands-document KBs via a generic task queue with dead-letter handling; the page-link graph gains a subgraph API + interactive exploration UI.
- **MCP Human-in-the-Loop Approval**: Sensitive MCP tool calls pause the agent and wait for explicit user approval in the chat UI.
- **More LLM / Vector DB / Storage / Search**: Anthropic (Claude), Apache Doris 4.1, Tencent VectorDB, Kingsoft Cloud KS3, and SearXNG are all new backends — pairing with the Vector Store management UI and per-KB indexing strategy toggles.
- **Deeper Observability**: Langfuse spans expanded across retrieval / rerank / agent stages; end-to-end TTFB logged on both ends of the chat stream; LLM call timeouts hardened to keep worker pools healthy.
- **Adaptive 3-Tier Chunking**: Documents are auto-routed to heading-aware / heuristic / recursive strategies, with a live preview panel in the KB editor. See [`docs/CHUNKING.md`](./docs/CHUNKING.md).
- **Global Command Palette**: A ⌘K palette replaces the standalone search page and can start a new chat directly from any result.
- **More Connectors & Mobile**: Yuque connector (full + incremental sync) joins Feishu / Notion; lightweight WeChat Mini Program client under `miniprogram/`.
- **`weknora` CLI (Preview)**: An early version of the official command-line client lives under `cli/` — feedback welcome.
- **Other Improvements**: Per-tenant RRF tuning, a dedicated query-understanding model, batch KB management, user-scoped session pinning, a tenant-wide IM channels overview, per-user font / theme preferences, a new OpenMaiC Classroom agent skill, and a full API-docs / Swagger / Client-SDK overhaul.
- **Bug Fixes**: Embedder `(nil, nil)` SIGSEGV fixed; Mimo / DeepSeek `reasoning_content` round-trip restored; multi-turn agent history rebuilt from DB (with attachment replay); OIDC login fixed; many Wiki ingest reliability fixes; FAQ no longer hallucinates summaries from filenames on empty PDFs.

`weknora` is the official CLI for driving the API from a terminal or AI agent.
The command surface mirrors `gh` CLI's `<noun> <verb>` convention; output is
human-readable by default and switches to a stable JSON envelope with `--json`.

```bash
weknora auth login --host https://kb.example.com
weknora kb list
weknora link --kb my-knowledge-base    # bind the current directory
weknora doc upload notes.md
weknora chat "summarise the design doc"
```

See [`cli/README.md`](./cli/README.md) for install + 5-minute quickstart
and [`cli/AGENTS.md`](./cli/AGENTS.md) for the operational contract that
AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, …) can rely on.
